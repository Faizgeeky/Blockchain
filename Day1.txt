Blockchain 

What is blockchain?
* Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.


--> It is differ from Bitcoin , bitcoin uses blockchain. It is algorithm which is secured and nearly impossible to Hack. As it used node to store the every Transactions.
--> All new transactions are connected with previous transaction node. so it is imoossible to change and all the transactions are publicy visible. 
--> There are 2 types of blockchain 
    * Private - Which are customized and made for private uses and are not open to all users
    * Public - Can be accessed by any person and it's publicly open for everyone (Bitcoin , ether, etc)
    
--> Use Cases:
    * Financial Orgs - Banks are using this to maintain and and track all the transaction 
    
--> It doesn't required trust becasuse it's secured and uses to transfer electronic fund over the Internet across all borders it's Globalaized decentralized system which means you can Transfer currencys to any region 

### Blocchain also consist of smart contract where apart prom sender and reciver others can also see the transcaions
### Also it is a way to send and recive digital money for P2P peer to peer

What is Bitcoin ?

* Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain

* Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that you can buy, sell and exchange directly, without an intermediary like a bank. Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, originally described the need for “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.


Bitcoin or other digital currency isn't saved in a file somewhere; it's represented by transactions recorded in a blockchain—kind of like a global spreadsheet or ledger, which leverages the resources of a large P2P network to verify and approve each Bitcoin transaction. Each blockchain, like the [Bitcoin blockchain] is distributed: it runs on computers provided by volunteers around the world. There is no central database to hack. The blockchain is public: anyone can view it at any time because it resides on the network… and the blockchain is encrypted… it uses public and private keys (rather like a two-key system to access a safety deposit box) to maintain virtual security.
